# Dataset and Benchmark Citations

This document provides citation information for all datasets and benchmarks used in this project.

## AMASS Motion Capture Data

This project uses motion capture data from the **AMASS** (Archive of Motion Capture as Surface Shapes) dataset. Specifically, I use the following subsets:

- **ACCAD**
- **CMU**
- **Transitions**
- **DanceDB**
- **KIT**
- **BMLrub**
- **GRAB**

**Complete BibTeX entries for AMASS and all subsets:** See [amass.bib](./amass.bib) (official citation file from AMASS)

**Primary AMASS citation:**
```bibtex
