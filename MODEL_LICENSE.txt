Version 1.0 — 2025-10-19
Applies to: Model weights released for HSyn9DHPE (checkpoints/*.pth)

By downloading, accessing, or using the HSyn9DHPE model weights ("Weights"), you agree:

1) GRANT — Non-Commercial Research/Education/Art only.
   You may use the Weights solely for non-commercial scientific research,
   non-commercial education, or non-commercial artistic projects.

2) PROHIBITED USES — The following uses are strictly prohibited:
   - Commercial purposes, including incorporation in commercial products,
     services, or artifacts
   - Pornographic, military, surveillance, defamatory, or libelous applications
   - Use for creating misleading, fake, or malicious content, except for
     analyses in peer-reviewed scientific research
   - Any use that violates applicable laws or regulations

3) NO COMMERCIAL TRAINING/SERVING — You may not use these Weights to:
   - Pre-train, fine-tune, or serve systems intended for commercial use
   - Improve commercial models or commercial products
   - Train methods, algorithms, neural networks, or other models for
     commercial purposes

4) NO REDISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DATA — You must NOT redistribute AMASS,
   SMPL, or any third-party data used to train these Weights.
   You must obtain these datasets directly from their original sources and
   accept their respective licenses:
   - AMASS: https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/
   - SMPL: https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/

5) ATTRIBUTION — If you use these Weights in your research, you must:
   a) Cite the AMASS dataset (ICCV 2019):

6) TAKEDOWN/CONSENT — If notified of a rights issue or consent withdrawal by:
   - AMASS rightsholders
   - SMPL rightsholders
   - The Author (Edoardo Compagnucci)

   You must immediately delete the Weights and any derivatives.

7) NO RE-IDENTIFICATION/EXTRACTION — You may not attempt to:
   - Extract original copyrighted motion capture data from the Weights
   - Re-identify subjects from the training data
   - Reverse-engineer the training dataset

8) NO WARRANTY / LIMITATION OF LIABILITY — The Weights are provided "AS IS"
   without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The Author is not liable
   for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Weights.

9) DERIVATIVES/FLOW-DOWN — If you create derivative works (fine-tuned models,
   distilled models, etc.), you may only distribute them under terms no less
   restrictive than this License.

10) TERMINATION — Any breach of these terms immediately terminates your rights.
    Upon termination, you must delete the Weights and all derivatives.
